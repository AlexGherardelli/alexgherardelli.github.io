Hello there! My name is Alessandra Gherardelli (Gherds for friends), I'm a web communications specialist at the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](http://www.fao.org/cfs). I am an orientalist-turned-geek and I'm passionate about web development, design, free education, languages and new technologies.

In this blog I talk about my own journey into web development and I share insights about my job and projects.
Stay tuned!
