My name is Alessandra Gherardelli (Gherds for friends), I'm a web communications specialist at the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](http://www.fao.org/cfs). I am an orientalist-turned-geek and I'm passionate about web development, design, free education, languages and new technologies.

You can check out some of the things I do in the Projects section or read me rambling about web development projects, design, digital marketing and learning resources in my blog. 

**Stay tuned!**
