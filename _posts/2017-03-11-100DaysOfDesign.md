After two months of sweating and negotiating, this week I've finally received my Adobe Creative Suite! It required convincing my boss that I really needed them, convincing the communications department that I knew what I was doing and getting the IT department to actually order it and install it for me. Such a bureaucratic working environment!
Anyway, now that I have the WHOLE suite, I realized how much there's actually to learn! It is not the first time I need to work in design, of course, but for most part so far I've used open source software like Gimp and Inkscape so this is really the first I'm "graduating" to the big industry-standard software.

This is why I'm committing to **100 days of design**. This challenge will be a modified version of the [100 days of coding](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.4a7gwlt9b), with few rules being adapted to make it more manageable. I work full time and my free time has to be divided with learning to code, going to the gym and social life! I will start the challenge on Monday 13th March and the challenge will be concluded on the 30th June 2017. It's not exactly 100 days, but I'm counting for days where I'll just be too busy or too tired to do anything!

The idea is to learn new skills so during this challenge, I'm committing to work everyday on a piece of design. I want to work in parallel on my web and print design skills, so I'll rotate the use of Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Xd.

Unlike the 100 days of code challenge, tutorials will count, but of course I'll give priority to real design projects, whether they are from work or personal projects. While getting money from my work will not be a priority, I'll also scan websites like 99design to get real projects.

I'll blog about it and update my Behance profile regularly, so by the end of the challenge I should have a nice portfolio to display!

Let's begin!
