So, last week I attended my first tech conference - Codemotion. It has been a great experience and I wanted to share a few thing I learnt in those two challenging and amazing days.

## 1. Developers should attend a lot of conferences. A. Lot.
Being self-taught, it does not happen too often to be able to confront myself with the rest of the world. I often wonder if I'm progressing too slowly, if I'm any good at building web apps or if I'm learning the right tools and technologies. 
 Attending a tech conference is an invaluable opportunity to learn, meet other people with similar interests and understand what it is hot in the developer community. You expose yourself to new technologies, new ideas, new people and this is simply priceless!

## 2. Challenge yourself at those conference!
In those two days of conference, I attended talks on topics I was quite comfortable in and on topics where I wasn't very familiar in. Guess which I enjoyed the most? 

Although I think it was a good idea to avoid those talks I couldn't even understand the title, I explored technologies such as Reach Native and containers, I listened the latest progress in machine learning and learned more about web optimization and component-based frameworks. At the end of the day, challenging myself on topics I didn't feel familiar with has been very rewarding. Even when I couldn't understand everything, it felt that I was at least exposed to something I could learn at my own pace later. 

## 3. The problem of gender disparity in tech is real
Codemotion was also the first time I actually saw how few women are in the tech sector compared to men. I've read about it a lot, but nothing could prepare me to the feeling of entering in a room of at least 200 people, to find no more than 3 or 4 women other than myself!

Luckily, this problem is perceived as quite serious by women and men alike - Google, the Python and JS local communities all had some initiatives to encourage women in tech and the biggest applause of the whole two days happened when a (male) speaker addressed the problem in a room full of guys!
