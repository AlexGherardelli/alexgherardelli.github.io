# What I learned from developing my first web app with Flask

Hello, world!

How do you start your first developement project?

An eternity ago, I started following the *amazing* Harvard CS50 - one of the best computer science free courses available out there. While I really took my time to complete all psets, I am now developing my first web app as CS50 final project. And let me tell you something, it is **dauting**.

I'd known for quite some time that I wanted to develop a web app as final project - all part of my grand plan to become a kick-ass web developer. The difficult part was deciding exactly **what** my web app should be about. After some thought, I decided it could have been be nice develop something to improve my job a web communications specialist: a social media management web app.

I regularly schedule my posts on social media (mostly Facebook and Twitter), but all the major social media scheduling tool do not allow to schedule the same post over and over again - you have to do it manually every time. Thing is, I have a lot of good, re-usable content and I'd like to reschedule it from time to time so that my editorial calendar is half-way done when I'm feeling lazy. So, that's the basic idea of the app!

As I starter, I decided that I would only work with the Twitter API and I would work with Python, since it's the only programming language where I don't feel completely crap at. Also, I bought a nice book called "Mining the social web", that teaches you how to get data from many social media using Python. So I thought that I could get few tips and tricks from there, without having to reinvent the wheel everytime I'm stuck somewhere.
