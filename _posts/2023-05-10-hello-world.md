I've been wanting to open a blog for quite some time now. So, here I am!

I work as a information management professional in an international organization and I am a convinced life-long learner. 

Over the years I taught myself how to code and I'm always passionate about learning new things, especially on computer science, math and data science. 

This blog wants to be a "travel journey" in my exciting journey as a self-taught learner of computer science and math (so many things to learn... so little time!). I will also review resources, books and courses I found particularly useful or interesting and share my experience as I go through them. 

I'm excited to embark on this new journey and I can't wait to see where it will take me. 

Thank you for joining me on this adventure, and I hope you enjoy reading my blog as much as I enjoy writing it!
