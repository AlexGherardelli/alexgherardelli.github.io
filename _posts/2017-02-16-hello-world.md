I've been wanting to open a blog for quite some time now. So, here I am!

I work as a web communications specialist in an international organization and I've been teaching myself web design and development for the past two years. I'm still not there quite yet, but I'm getting better :)

This blog wants to be a "travel journal" as a go through my web development/design education and learn how to use this newly acquired knowledge at work.I will also review educational resources, books and technologies that I found particularly useful or interesting and share any tips and tricks that may be useful for people.

I think it's good to document one's efforts, but it is mostly my way of giving back to the amazing communities spread around the Internet around free education and open source software.

I hope that people will find my rambling useful so... let's get started!
