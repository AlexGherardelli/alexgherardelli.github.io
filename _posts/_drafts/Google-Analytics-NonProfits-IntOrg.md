# Google Analytics for non-profits and international organizations

Knowing what works and what doesn’t is one of the most effective ways to refine your web outreach strategy. Google Analytics is a powerful tool to get to understand your users and improve their experience on your website. 

Although it is slightly geared towards commercial websites, it is a very flexible tool and it can be successfully used by international organizations and non-profits to understand user behaviour.

This guide will assume a familiarity with the Google Analytics reporting interface. All examples are from my own work in the (Committee on World Food Security (CFS))[http://www.fao.org/cfs], where we have recently our web analytics strategy.

## Prepare a measurement plan

Before starting analyzing data, it is important to have a well-made **measurement plan**. A measurement plan defines the overall objectives and how to match these goals with Strameasurable targets. This will help also to stay on track and to measure only what we are really interested in.

For the Committee on World Food Security (for now, CFS), I divided the measurement plan into 6 sections:
- Overall goals
- Strategies
- Targets
- Segmentation
- Metrics and dimensions
- Configuration

### Goals

These are the high-level goals that we want to achieve with our outreach. Mission statements are usually a good starting point for this!

For example, CFS is a United Nations intergovernmental body for developing food security and nutrition policies. For our online outreach strategy I came up with three main goals:
- Help visitors find information
- Create awareness about our products and activities
- Engage online communities

Other common goals that many organization may want to include is to raise donations or increase the number of volunteers.

### Strategies

Strategies are the tactics to achieve the main goals.

For CFS, I’ve decided that “Improving the website usability and content” would help visitors find they information they seek; that promoting our policy products, communications material and events would create awareness on CFS, and that to engage online communities we would consolidate our social media presence, write regularly on our blog and work on our newsletter. <!-- Rewrite this -->

### Targets

Targets should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound!

In the targets section, you should specify exactly what you want to obtain and: that 10% increase in newsletter subscriptions or 5% more visitors coming from East Asia!

For CFS I exactly did that. I decided that in 2017, for example, we want more policy recommendations downloaded and that we’ll be tracking event attendance. We also want to improve our usability, and for that I'll use bounce rate and time on website as primary metrics.
