# Google Analytics for non-profits and international organizations

Knowing what works and what doesnâ€™t is one of the most effective ways to refine your web outreach strategy. Google Analytics is a powerful tool to get to understand your users and improve their experience on your website. 

Although it is slightly geared towards commercial websites, it is a very flexible tool and it can be successfully used by international organizations and non-profits to understand user behaviour.

This guide will assume a familiarity with the Google Analytics reporting interface. All examples are from my own work in the (Committee on World Food Security (CFS))[http://www.fao.org/cfs], where we have recently our web analytics strategy.

## Getting ready

Before starting, it is important to have clear in mind what you want to measure and why. This step requires some times to set up a proper measurement plan, which defines the objectives and how to match them with measurable targets. A good measurement plan will also help you stay on track without getting distracted with the many stats available on Google Analytics.

A measurement plan will have these sections:

- **Goals**: the high-level goals that we want to achieve with our outreach. Mission statements are usually a good starting point for this. Common goals for international and non-profit organizations include rising awareness, help visitors find information, raise donations, increase the number of volunteers and engage online commmunities.
- **Strategies**: this section will include how you plan to achieve your goals. For example, you might want to improve the website usability to retain more users or set up an online donations system to raise funds.
- **KPIs**: you will next to define your targets or key performance indicators (KPIs). Targets should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound! In other words, make sure your targets are quantitative, feasable and relevant to your organization's mission.

Other things you should keep in mind at this point is how you would like to segment your data. Segmentation allows you to isolate and analyze subset of your data. Are you interested in your visitors' geographical location? Would you like to know if you users access your website on their laptop or on their phone? Or are you more interested to know who donates more, new or returning users?
