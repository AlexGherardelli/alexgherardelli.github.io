# Google Analytics for non-profits and international organizations: a primer

Knowing what works and what doesnâ€™t is one of the most effective ways to improve your website. After all, don't we all want to have successful, informative, interesting websites?

Google Analytics is a one of most powerful tools in your toolbox to understand your users and improve their experience on your website. Although it is slightly geared towards commercial websites, it is very flexible and it can be successfully used by international organizations and non-profits to understand user behaviour online.

## Getting ready

Before starting, it is important to have clear in mind what you want to measure and why. This step requires a little bit of time as you will create a measurement plan, which defines the general objectives and measurable performance indicators. A good measurement plan will also help you stay on track without getting distracted with the many stats and reports available in Google Analytics.

A measurement plan will usually have these sections:

- **Goals**: the high-level objectives that we want to achieve with our outreach strategy. Mission statements are usually a good starting point for this step. Common goals for international and non-profit organizations include rising awareness, help visitors find information, raise donations, increase the number of volunteers and engage online commmunities.
- **Strategies**: this section will include how you plan to achieve your goals. For example, you might want to improve the website usability to engage and retain users or set up an online donations system to raise funds.
- **KPIs**: next, you will have to define your targets or key performance indicators (KPIs). Targets should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound! In other words, make sure your targets are feasable within a reasonable timeframe and relevant to your organization's mission.

Other things you should keep in mind at this point is how you would like to segment your data. Segmentation allows you to isolate and analyze subset of your data. For example, are you interested in your visitors' geographical location? Would you like to know if you users access your website on their laptop or on their phone? Or are you more interested to know who donates more, new or returning users? All of these are example of segmentation available in Google Analytics.

## Getting started

Configuring Google Analytics to track everything you need may require the help of a techie or use [Google Tag Manager](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821?visit_id=1-636221681289895179-2873153591&rd=1), if already set up.
Other than the basic analytics tag - a short Javascript snippet that keeps track of your data and sends it to Google servers for processing - these are few things you might want to implement on your website:

* **Events**: Google Analytics only tracks page views by default, but with a bit of configuration (and the help of a developer) you can track any type of user interactions. Want to know if people are watching your videos? Add an event! Want to see if your user are downloading your reports? Yep, you guessed it, you need to add an event!
* **Goals**: Goals are there to help you tracking your measurement targets. A goal correspond to a user completing one activity (a conversion, in marketing terms). These could be something like signing up to the newsletter, donating an amout of money, recommending an article on social media or have a certain level of engagement with your website, like visiting more than 5 pages in one session. You can even prioritize your conversions with goal values: low priority may be worth 1 and high priority conversions may have a value of 100. 
* **Campaigns tracking**:
* Content grouping
* Keywords and SEO

## 1, 2, 3, GO!

So, now that you have your measurement plan, you can focus on getting data and transform them into actionable improvements for your website. Sounds great, uh?

Thing is, when you first open Google Analytics you might feel a bit overwhelmed with numbers! But fear not, here is what you should look for!

## Core Metrics
The general health of your website is provided by only six metrics. Right, just six! These are sessions, page views, users, bounce rate, pages/session and average session duration. They are all available under Audience overview, which is the default report you will see when you log in Google Analytics.

It is interesting to keep in mind how sessions, time on site and bounce rate are calculated. Here is a short, informative explaination of what these metrics are and how they are computed[link].

Sessions, page views, users, bounce rate and time spent are very interesting metrics both for your website overall and for single pages. Bounce rates is, in particular, the single most important metric at your disposal, as it will highlight where your website's shortcomings are and how bad they are. Generally speaking, a bounce rate of 50% or lower is okay, between 60 and 65% is worrisome and above 65% is terrible - and requires your immediate attention.
A very high bounce rate may mean that your users are not finding what they were looking for, either because of technical problems (e.g. a link is broken or the page takes too much time to load) or of content (e.g. they didn't like what they see). Unless you are analysing a blog or a one-page website, high bounce rates are **always** an indication of a problem, and you should do something to fix it!
