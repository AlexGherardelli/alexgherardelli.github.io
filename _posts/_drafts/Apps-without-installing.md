title: How to use your favourite apps without admin rights
---

One of the things that really bothers me at work is that I cannot install applications as I like. While I completely understand why IT departments restrict user rights, this means that I have to go through a long bureacratic process just to have some software installed.

Not having admin rights in a computer can be quite frequent in other situations as well, such as using a computer in a public library or in an internet caf√®. 
These are few things you can do to solve this annoying problem!

## 1: The dumb solution: online apps
Cloud-based apps are literally EXPLODING in the last few years. Just think of the whole Gsuite/Google Apps: you get to have a document processor, spreadsheet, presentation software, calendar and more that are quite similar to more famous programmes such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint.

Chances are that that software that you run all the time on your computer has an online-only counterpart that works fine for most uses. You can find online convertors, pdf editors, graphic editors, note taking apps, and so much more.

Other than not having to install them, online apps often are good for backups and keeping the system clean.

Other than the Gsuite (which I use quite intensively everyday), I find that small tasks such as converting a file or downloading a YouTube video are done best with online applications: since I don't have to run these types of operation on a daily basis, so I prefer to keep my system a little bit cleaner.

## 2: The smart solution: portable apps
I would be completely lost without portable apps! Portable apps are application that you can run anywhere, even on a USB stick. Many of the most popular applications like Firefox, VLC Player or 7-Zip have a portable version that doesn't require admin rights  to run.

There are a few portable app suits around: the most popular one is (PortableApps)[http://portableapps.com], which has over 200 different applications to chose from, ranging from browsers to developer tools and games!

Portable apps are really a precious swissknife that everyone should bring around all the time!

## 3: The geeky solution: portable OS
The last option is the smartest of them all: having another portable operative system running from a USB stick! In this way 

but also the most complicated to put in practice: you should be comfortable with the idea of messing around with your computer's boot system!
