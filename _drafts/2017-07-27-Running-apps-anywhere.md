One of the things that really bothers me at work is that I cannot install applications as I like. While I completely understand why IT departments restrict user rights, this means that I have to go through a long bureacratic process just to have some software installed.

Not having admin rights in a computer can be quite frequent in other situations as well, such as using a computer in a public library or in an internet caf√®. Here are few things you can do to solve this annoying problem!

## 1: The easy solution: online apps
Chances are that that software that you run all the time on your computer has an online-only counterpart that works fine for most uses. You can find online convertors, pdf editors, graphic editors, note taking apps, and so much more.

Cloud-based apps are literally **exploding** in the last few years. Just think of the whole Google Apps Suite: you have a document processor, spreadsheet, presentation software, calendar and more that are quite similar to more famous programmes such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint. They also have tons of add-ons to extend them. 

Other than the Google Apps Suite (which I use quite intensively everyday), I find that small tasks such as converting a file or downloading a YouTube video are done best with online applications: since I don't have to run these types of operation on a daily basis, so I prefer to keep my system a little bit cleaner.

## 2: The smarter solution: portable apps
I would be completely lost without portable apps! Portable apps are application that you can run anywhere, even on a USB stick. Many of the most popular applications like Firefox, VLC Player or 7-Zip have a portable version that doesn't require admin rights  to run.

There are a few portable app suits around: the most popular one is (PortableApps)[http://portableapps.com], which has over 200 different applications to chose from, ranging from browsers to developer tools and games!
One of the less known yet useful features of the PortableApp platform is that you can even install fonts without admin rights - a god-sent for graphic designers everywhere!

Portable apps are a precious swissknife that everyone should bring around all the time!

## 3: The ultimate solution: portable OS
If you are comfortable with getting your hands dirty, this is the ultimate solution: running a full operative system directly from your USB flashdrive. While this requires to mess around with the booting system of the host computer, you'll be able to bring around all your files and applications anywhere, anytime.

The easiest way to create your bootable OS is with [Universal USB Installer](https://www.pendrivelinux.com/). Although some distributions such as Porteus or Puppy Linux are lighter and perform better if run from an USB stick, you can make a portable version of pretty much any Linux distribution. With a large enough USB, you can even run more demanding distros like Ubuntu!

I've personally experimented with Puppy Linux (Slacko) and I was very happy with it: it run smoothly on my 4GB USB drive, it allowed for persistence (which means you can save files and applications as you'd normally do in your regular OS) and it was quite pretty to look at too!
