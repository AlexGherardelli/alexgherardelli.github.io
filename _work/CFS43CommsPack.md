I designed a full communication package to promote the 43rd session of the Committee on World Food Security, the only committee in the United Nations system specifically tasked to tackle food security and nutrition. The package included a poster, side event booklet, routing signs and a [responsive web timetable](https://uncfs.github.io/CFS43Timetable/).
