title: Designing event posters
---

My team doesnâ€™t organize many events, but when we do then the stakes are high and a good promotion is in order! Over the years, I designed few posters and promotional materials for events, such as:
* A side event to the United Nations High Level Political Forum, held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, 12 July 2017
* Two events on nutrition and food systems, held at FAO headquarters in Rome, 9 and 26 May 2017
* [A workshop on protracted crises, held at the United Nations office in Nairobi, 19 September 2016](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55116947/Leaving-no-one-behind-invites-to-CFS-events-on-war)
* [A side event to the United Nations High Level Political Forum, held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, 17 July 2016](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55116947/Leaving-no-one-behind-invites-to-CFS-events-on-war)
