I designed a full [communication package to promote the 43rd session of the Committee on World Food Security](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55075241/CFS-43rd-Session-Communication-package), the only committee in the United Nations system specifically tasked to tackle food security and nutrition. The package included a poster, side event booklet, routing signs and a [responsive web timetable](https://uncfs.github.io/CFS43Timetable/).

Over the years, I also designed few posters and promotional materials for events, such as:
* [A side event to the United Nations High Level Political Forum, held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, 12 July 2017](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55189293/Communication-package-event-on-conflict)
* [Two events on nutrition and food systems, held at FAO headquarters in Rome, 9 and 26 May 2017](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55116877/Communication-Package-Nutrition-Event-Series)
* [A workshop on protracted crises, held at the United Nations office in Nairobi, 19 September 2016](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55116947/Leaving-no-one-behind-invites-to-CFS-events-on-war)
* [A side event to the United Nations High Level Political Forum, held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, 17 July 2016](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55116947/Leaving-no-one-behind-invites-to-CFS-events-on-war)


RIMA is a FAO project aimed at understanding resilience to food insecurity in the developing world. I helped them effectively present their statistical reports to development practitioners, project managers and policy makers through a set of communications outlets.
