A while ago, I suggested my team to open up a Medium blog to make our policy recommendations "human-readable" and engage with our online audience. The experiment has been quite successful so far, with blog posts being published every couple of months. Here's a few I've personally written:
* [Ocean’s 2030: Our oceans are our future](https://medium.com/@UN_CFS/oceans-2030-e29b5c444259)
* [Feeding the future: How to inspire the next generation of farmers](https://medium.com/@UN_CFS/feeding-the-future-a2f014946865)
* [Investing for good: How responsible agricultural investment can generate positive social impact](https://medium.com/@UN_CFS/investing-for-good-b184a714cb38)

After graduating in Chinese and Development studies, I wrote for almost two years short, insightful analysis on major Chinese sociopolitical events for two main Italian research institutes, ISPI and ISAG. Below a few examples in Italian: 
* [Colpire tigri e mosche: successi e criticità della campagna anti-corruzione di Xi Jinping](http://www.ispionline.it/it/pubblicazione/colpire-tigri-e-mosche-successi-e-criticita-della-campagna-anti-corruzione-di-xi-jinping-11558)
* [Il movimento dell'Ombrello e l'identità di Hong Kong](http://www.affaritaliani.it/esteri/il-movimento-171014.html)
* [Xinjiang: un esempio di colonialismo interno?](http://www.geopolitica-online.com/26118/xinjiang-un-esempio-di-colonialismo-interno)
