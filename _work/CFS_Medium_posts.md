A while ago, I suggested my team to open up a Medium blog to make our policy recommendations "human-readable" and engage with our online audience. The experiment has been quite successful so far, with blog posts being published every couple of months. Here's a few I've personally written:
* [Oceanâ€™s 2030: Our oceans are our future](https://medium.com/@UN_CFS/oceans-2030-e29b5c444259)
* [Feeding the future: How to inspire the next generation of farmers](https://medium.com/@UN_CFS/feeding-the-future-a2f014946865)
* [Investing for good: How responsible agricultural investment can generate positive social impact](https://medium.com/@UN_CFS/investing-for-good-b184a714cb38)
