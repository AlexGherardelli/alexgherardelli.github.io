title: Automating an email management system
---
My team at FAO had an overly complicated email list system that had to be manually updated. It was unmanageable and very time consuming, so I hacked up a new little system with Google Forms, Sheets and Google Apps Scripts. Now our users can signup and unsubscribe themselves from our email notifications, meeting attendance is registered through a tablet and our mailing lists are always updated!
