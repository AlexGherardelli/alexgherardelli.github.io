I’ve been wanting a clean-looking space to showcase all the things I did, so I started coding this portfolio website from scratch with Jekyll and good ol’ HTML and CSS. Feel free to check out the code on [Github](https://github.com/AlexGherardelli/mnml)
<!--If you like my website, feel free to download the theme from Github!-->
