title: Mini projects
---
In my free time, I love to build mini projects to experiments with a design,  explore new technologies and learn new things. Few Iâ€™m quite happy with are:
* [Email2CSV](https://github.com/AlexGherardelli/Experiments/tree/master/email_re), a small Python script to convert all emails contained in a text file into a csv file. Very useful to build up mailing lists!
* A [Pomodoro Clock](http://fcc-pomodoroclock.surge.sh/), a time management method to be more productive
* A [Javascript Calculator](http://fcc-jscalc.surge.sh/)
* [Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/AlexGhrd/pen/QvwNdj), an app which allows to search Wikipedia entries
* A [presentation to the CFS Side Events](https://github.com/AlexGherardelli/CFS_presentation), made with Reveal.js and C3.js
