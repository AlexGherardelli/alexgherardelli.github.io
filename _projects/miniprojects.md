title: Mini projects
---
In my free time, I love to build mini projects to experiments with a design,  explore new technologies and learn new things. Few Iâ€™m quite happy with are:
* Email2CSV, a small Python script to convert all emails contained in a text file into a csv file. Very useful to build up mailing lists!
* Wikipedia Viewer, an app which allows to search Wikipedia entries
* A web-based presentation made with Reveal.js and C3.js
