Presenting complex ideas in a simple yet accurate way is vital to make sure that everyone can have access and understand important technical topics. 


In this respect, my work with the FAO Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis team has been particularly interesting. The team produces quantitative analyses and reports to understand the resilience to food insecurity in few African countries. These reports aim to provide the evidence to better design, monitor and evaluate assistance programmes. However, being very statistically heavy, these analysese often fail to reach their intended audiences, who often lacked the statistical background to understand the raw analysis.
My job was therefore to write web and in-print communications material that would effectively present this analytical tool to development practitioners, project managers and policy makers. A few examples of these writing can be found [here] (http://www.fao.org/resilience/background/tools/rima/en/) and [here](http://www.fao.org/resilience/resources/resources-detail/en/c/405048/).

During 2013 and 2014 I collaborated with two different research institutes on international politics. The audience of the two institutes are political science students, politicians and businesses interested in expanding their foreign markets. My job in both institutes was to provide short, insightful analysis on major Chinese political and economic trends and events.
